# personal-finances-app

A shiny app that I put together for two purposes:

1. To help me learn how shiny for R works; and
2. To finally get a handle on where I'm spending my money.

The app reads data that I have been collecting in a google drive spreadsheet and produces dynamic charts and analysis based on the information.
